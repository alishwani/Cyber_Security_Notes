1- Footprinting a Web Server using the httprecon tool

2- Uniscan Web Server Fingerprinting in Kali Linux 
Choose Wampserver64 in Windows 

Launch uniscan -h in kali 
uniscan -h 
uniscan -u <http://example.com/oscp> -q
The result of the scan gets saved to /usr/share/uniscan/report

3- Cracking FTP Credentials using Dictionary Attack 
First, perform an Nmap scan. 
nmap -p 21 <ip address>
If you find an ftp port open then test it by connecting to it using: ftp <IP address>, enter user name and pass 

To brute force the ftp login, use hydra tool in Kali linux. 
hydra -L /root/Wordlists/usernames.txt -P /root/Wordlists/Passwords.txt ftp://<IP address> 
* Hydra will try all different combination trying to guess the right username/password credentials. 
Once you obtain the correct credentials, you can type help for all the commands that you can run on the ftp server.
