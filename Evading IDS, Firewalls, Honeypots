###Detecting Intrusion Using Snort###
Install and Launch Snort.exe
By Default, Snort folder is created in C:\Snort. In etc folder, copy snort.conf from C:\snort\snortrules\etc to c:\Snort\etc
Then copy so_rules folder from folder Snort\snortrules to C:\Snort. 
Then copy preproc_rules folder from folder Snort\snortrules to C:\Snort by replacing the exisiting preproc_rules in c:\Snort.

Then copy rules folder from folder Snort\snortrules to C:\Snort. 
Open CMD in c:\Snort\bin folder, then type snort. 
Type "snort -W" to view Physical Address, IP Address, and Ethernet Drivers, and all disabled by default.
To enable the Ethernet Driver, type "snort -dev -i 1" 
leave CMD open and launch another CMD windows and type "ping google.com". This ping command will trigger a Snort alert inn the Snort command prmpt with rapid scrolling text.

### Bypassing Windows Firewall using Nmap Evasion Techniques###

nmap -v -sS -T5 IP Address of the victim

-v = verbose
-sS = TCP SYN 
-T5 = time template to perform scan

nmap -v -sS -f -T5 IP address of the vicitm machine

-f = Cause the requested scan (including ping scans) to use tiny fragmented IP packets to be sent to the victim machine.

nmap -v -sS -f --mtu 32 -T5 IP Address of the victim machine
--mtu 32 = means the packet size is 32 bytes

nmap -v -sS -f --mtu 32 --send-eth -T5 IP address of the victim machine.

--send-etho = ensures that Nmap actually sends Ethernet levle packets, and will bypass the IP layer and send raw Ethernet frames within the traffic.

nmap -v -sS -f --mtu 32 --send-eth --data-length 500 -T5 IP address of the vicitm

data length up to 500

nmap =v -sS -f --mtu 32 --send-eth --data-length 50 --source-port 99 -T5 IP Address of the victim machine

--source-port is used to spoof the source port number.
